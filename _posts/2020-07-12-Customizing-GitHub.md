A new feature arrived on GitHub a few days ago!

This is how it works:

1.  Create a repo with your username (e.g.  [https://github.com/EliteDaMyth/EliteDaMyth](https://github.com/EliteDaMyth/EliteDaMyth))
2.  Create a  `README.md`  file.
3.  Add content, e.g. a image, links and an introduction text, and commit the file
4.  `git push`  your changes.

That's it.

This is how it looks:
